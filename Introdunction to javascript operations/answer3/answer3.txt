The Operators can be categorized based on the number of operands they require.
The three categories of operators based on the number of operands they require are:
1. Unary operators: which require one operand.
    For Example: 
      typeof "hi"  //string
2. Binary operators: which require two operands.All arithmetic operators are binary operators.
    For Example: 
      10 + 20  //30
3. Ternary operators: which require three operands.In JavaScript, there is one operator that falls under this category â€“ the conditional operator.
