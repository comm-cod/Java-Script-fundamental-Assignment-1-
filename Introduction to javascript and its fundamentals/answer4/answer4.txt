Purpose of declaring Variables in JavaScript: 
1. JavaScript variables are used to store data that can be changed later on. 
2. The variables can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container.
3. Variables can be used to control the flow of your program through conditions and loops.

Declaring variable using the 'let' keyword:-
-- The let keyword is one of the several ways to declare a variable within JavaScript:-
1. To declare a variable using let in JavaScript, you only need to use “let” followed by a variable name.
2. You can declare a variable without assigning it a value. However, it will be considered undefined by JavaScript until it is assigned a value.
3. One of the first things you should note is that when you declare a variable in JavaScript using let, you cannot redeclare it within the same block scope. This behavior is helpful because you cannot accidentally redeclare a variable declared within the same code block.

FOR EXAMPLE:- let variableName; // Varaible declared
              variableName = value; // Variable initialized
