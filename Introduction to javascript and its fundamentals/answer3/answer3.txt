The five primitive data types in JavaScript are as follows :-

1. String :- A String is a sequence of characters used to represent text.
          :- For a String you can use either single or double quotes to create a string.
For example :- let str1 = "Hello";
              let str2 = 'Hello World!';
            
2. Number :- Number represents numerical values and it can be integers, etc.
          :- For a Number, numerical operations like addition, substraction, division and multiplication can be performed.    
For example :- let num = 3;

3. Boolean :- Boolean are logical entities and can only have two values: true or false.
          :- Boolean it is used in conditional statements, it returns either true or false.
For example:-  5 > 3 // true;
               6 < 3 // false;

4. Undefined :- Undefined implies that no value has been assigned to a variable.
             :- The Undefined value is returned when you try to access a not yet declared variable.
For example:- let example;
              console.log(example); // Undefined     

5. Null :- Null denotes that a variable has no value or no object. It is deliberately assigned to a variable.
        :- Null is an assigned value that means nothing.       
For example:- let example = null;
              console.log(example); // null
